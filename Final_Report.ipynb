    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The government of Canada provides historical data on weather and climate. Its' hourly weather data report consists of various climate observations such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed, as well as a column classifying the weather type (e.g. \"Mostly Cloudy\"). We are excited to test our ability to build a classification model for weather types based on climate observations from this dataset. To make our project more enjoyable and personal, we decided to work with historical weather and climate data provided by the 'Vancouver Intl A' weather station, which is not far from UBC. This facility, located in the Vancouver International Airport, is one of the most significant weather stations in Vancouver that collects measurements for weather forecasts and climate studies hourly. Unlike hourly data reports, daily and monthly data reports do not include a weather column making it impossible to build a classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering seasonal climate differences and fluctuations, we decided to focus on weather reports from June, to reduce the number of external factors affecting the observations. As we will be handling an hourly data report, we have sufficient observations to build a classification model. In addition, to minimize the influence of global warming on temperature for our classification model, we will use recent data to train our model: June 2022."

    "## Methods & Results\n",
    "1. Download all June 2022 hourly data from the government of Canada website, tidy it, and combine it into one dataframe.\n",
    "2. Split the data into `training_set` and `testing_set`.\n",
    "3. Select the predictor variables that results in the highest accuracy in a forward selection process\n",
    "4. Create a recipe that uses the predictors selected and a model specification with tuning on the number of neighbours using `tune()`. Also Use the `step_scale(all_predictors())` function and the `step_center(all_predictors())` function to scale and center our data. While using `step_upsample` function to solve class imbalance if necessary.\n",
    "5. Perform a 5-fold cross-validation on the training set using `vfold_cv` function\n",
    "6. Create a workflow analysis with our recipe and model specification using `workflow()` function\n",
    "7. Collect the metrics from the workflow analysis using the `collect_metrics` function.\n",
    "8. Plot the $k$ vs the accuracy and identify which $k$ the most optimal for our data set for k-nn classification. \n",
    "9. Create a new model specification for with the identified best value $k$ using the `nearest_neighbor()` function.\n",
    "10. Train the classifier with the training data set using the `workflow` function. Instead of using `fit` or `fit_resamples`, we will use the `tune_grid` function to fit the model for each value in a range of parameter values. For the `resamples` argument, we will input the cross-validation model we created earlier.\n",
    "11. Use our final model to predict on the test dataset `testing_set`\n",
    "12. Record the accuracy of this prediction, and store this in an object\n",
    "13. Plot the accuracy of our model on a bar graph for each category of Weather column"

    "As mentioned above, since we initially intended to use June 2022 data for our testing set, the name of the combined tidy data of June 2022 is called the testing_set.csv. \n",
    "\n",
    "While we were working on our model with our training set (combined file with June 2020 and 2021 data), we encountered a problem where the accuracy estimates for different numbers of neighbors returned 100% accuracy for all values of k. Our initial instinct was to test if this pattern persists even if we reduce the number of observations by randomly sampling 1000 observations from our training set. This time, our accuracy was also very high at around 97% for k = 1 and 2, then gradually decreased as the number of neighbors increased. Such problems were unforeseen errors caused by our data set's characteristics. Our weather data is a time-series data where each observation is indexed in time order. So, the recorded variable in the weather column was bound to the observation made at that particular time.\n",
    "Consequently, the time-related component of our data had a negative impact on the predictions as we increased the number of neighbors. Furthermore, the KNN classification model we covered in DSCI 100 uses a Euclidian distance metric that cannot measure the distance between multiple time series. This suggests a possible reason that accuracy decreases as we increase the number of neighbors. Thus, we suspected that a large number of observations in our training set, 16890 rows (shown below), were disturbing the accuracy measures. As a result, we decided to sample 500 observations from the most recent 2022 data (testing set) to minimize the effect of both time aspects of our data and the influence of global warming on temperature for our classification model."
