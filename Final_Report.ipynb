    "The government of Canada provides historical data on weather and climate. Its' hourly weather data report consists of various climate observations such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed, as well as a column classifying the weather type (e.g. \"Mostly Cloudy\"). We are excited to test our ability to build a classification model for weather types based on climate observations from this dataset. To make our project more enjoyable and personal, we decided to work with historical weather and climate data provided by the 'Vancouver Intl A' weather station, which is not far from UBC. This facility, located in the Vancouver International Airport, is one of the most significant weather stations in Vancouver that collects measurements for weather forecasts and climate studies hourly. Unlike hourly data reports, daily and monthly data reports do not include a weather column making it impossible to build a classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering seasonal climate differences and fluctuations, we decided to focus on weather reports from June, to reduce the number of external factors affecting the observations. As we will be handling an hourly data report, we have sufficient observations to build a classification model. In addition, to minimize the influence of global warming on temperature for our classification model, we will use recent data to train our model: June 2020 and June 2021. For the testing set, we will be using reports from June 2022, which will allow us to use the most recent weather data available to check the accuracy of our classification model."
